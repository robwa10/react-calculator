# React-Redux Calculator  

[Live Demo](https://my-react-calculator.herokuapp.com/)  

A React based calculator utilizing Redux for state management.  A personal project undertaken to increase understanding, skills and refresh knowledge in the following areas:  

**JavaScript at Large** - The challenge of creating the logic to compute calculations is a great way to dive deeper into JavaScript.  
**Test Driven Development** - The logic of the calculator was created first utilizing [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to drive testing and development.  
**Progressive Web App** - (In Development) The calculator should function as a native app.  
**React** - React's compositional nature make it ideal to develop the components of the calculator.  
**Redux** - Although state could have been managed in React I decided to use Redux to refresh familiarity with it's syntax.
